    <title>Statement Conclusion</title>
</head>

<body>
    <p><strong>Directions –</strong> Under this test in the question a statement is given, followed by two conclusions. It is not necessary that the conclusions may have direct relation to the statement. The candidate has to ascertain whether or not the
        conclusion has direct relation to statement –</p>
    <h2>Statement Conclusion Examples</h2>
    <p><strong>Example 1:</strong><br />
        <strong>Statement :</strong> Each honest man is awarded a medal.<br />
        <strong>Conclusions :</strong> <strong>I.</strong> Ram should be awarded a medal.<br />
        <strong>II.</strong> Ram should not be awarded a medal because he is not honest.<br />
        <strong>(A)</strong> Only conclusion I is correct<br />
        <strong>(B)</strong> Only conclusion II is correct<br />
        <strong>(C)</strong> Neither conclusion I nor conclusion II is correct<br />
        <strong>(D)</strong> Both the conclusions are correct.<br />
        <strong>Solution (B)</strong> – Conclusion I is not correct, there is no discussion of the main fact of the statement in it.<br />
        <strong>Conclusion II</strong> is correct because it clearly states that Ram should not be given the medal because he is not honest.<br /> Some times there are two statements and one conclusion in the test of these questions. The candidate has
        to find out on the basis of the conclusion of the statement as to which option of the answer is related to the conclusion.</p>
    <p><strong>Example 2.</strong><br />
        <strong>Statement : I</strong>. 2 and 3 are odd numeral respectively.<br />
        <strong>II.</strong> 2 and 3 make 5 together.<br />
        <strong>Conclusion :</strong> 5 is an even and odd numerical.</p>
    <p><strong>(A)</strong> Conclusion is correct.<br />
        <strong>(B)</strong> Conclusion is incorrect.<br />
        <strong>(C)</strong> Perhaps the conclusion is correct.<br />
        <strong>(D)</strong> Conclusion is inconsistent.<br />
        <strong>Solution (B) –</strong> The conclusion is different from the main fact of the statement because 5 has been stated to be both an even and odd numeral whereas in actually 5 is an odd numeral. So, the conclusion in obviously incorrect.</p>
