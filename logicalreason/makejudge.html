    <p><em>A decision is the final outcome of the process of evaluating and analyzing data. System</em><em>atic analysis of facts and figure reduces the chances of inaccuracy and ensures sp</em><em>eedy decision making.</em></p>
    <p id="Important-Notes">Judgment is defined as a process of combining knowledge and understanding with common sense. Even though judgment questions resemble reading comprehension questions, they are different in that you must choose the best answer based on your accumulated
        knowledge and common sense. The answer will not necessarily be given in the reading selection. Clues to the correct answer, however, may be found in the reading passage, so reading comprehension will play a large part in answering judgment questions
        correctly.</p>
    <p>To recognize judgment questions and understand how to answer them, try the following practice exercises. You must read the passage and choose the best answer for the question asked. The correct answers and explanations of those answers follow the
        exercise.</p>
    <h2>Solved Examples - Making Judgments</h2>
    <p><em><strong>Example 1:</strong> </em>Decisions about handcuffing or restraining inmates are often up to the corrections officers involved. An officer is legally responsible for exercising good judgment and for taking necessary precautions to prevent
        harm both to the inmate involved and to others. In which one of the following situations is handcuffing or other physical restraint most likely to be needed?</p>
    <ol>
        <li>An inmate seems to have lost control of his senses and is banging his fists repeatedly against the bars of his cell.</li>
        <li>During the past two weeks, an inmate has deliberately tried to start three fights with other inmates.</li>
        <li>An inmate claims to be sick and refuses to leave his cell for a scheduled meal.</li>
        <li>During the night, an inmate begins to shout and sing, disturbing the sleep of other inmates.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Answer – (1)<br />
</strong><b>Explanations – </b>The inmate who repeatedly bangs his fists against the bars of his cell is in immediate danger of causing himself bodily harm. The inmate must be restrained. The other inmates require attention, and their situations must
        be dealt with, but they do not require physical restraint.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Example 2:</strong></em> While you are working on a routine assignment, a coworker asks you to help her for a few minutes so that she can complete an assignment that has top priority and must be completed immediately. Of the following,
        the best action for you to take should be to</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Tell her to find somebody else who does not look busy and ask that person for help.</li>
        <li>Tell her you will help her as soon as you complete your own work.</li>
        <li>Help her to complete her assignment and then go back to your work.</li>
        <li>Tell her that your work is as important to you as her work is to her, and continue to work on your own assignment.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><b>Answer - (3)<br />
Explanations – </b>There are a number of points to take into consideration: Your own task is described as routine; the coworker’s assignment is described as one that has top priority; and the coworker has asked for only a few minutes of your time. If
        you were involved in “rush’ work yourself, you might refuse to help until you had finished your own task, but under these, circumstances, help get the priority work done. A side benefits to be considered here is maintaining a good relationship
        with the coworker, so that you, too, may request assistance at some time when your job demands it.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Example 3:</strong></em> A police officer stationed along the route of a parade has been ordered not to allow cars to cross the route while the parade is in progress. An ambulance driver on an emergency run attempts to drive an ambulance
        across the route while the parade is passing. Under these circumstances, the officer should</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Ask the driver to wait while the officer calls headquarters and obtains a decision.</li>
        <li>Stop the parade long enough to permit the ambulance to cross the street.</li>
        <li>Direct the ambulance driver to the shortest detour available, which will add at least ten minutes to the run.</li>
        <li>Hold up the ambulance in accordance with the order.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><b>Answer - (2)<br />
Explanations – </b>Without any knowledge of police rules, common sense dictates that saving lives is the number one priority. An ambulance on an emergency run is on a mission to save a life. Lifesaving takes precedence over the desire for an uninterrupted
        parade, despite the officer’s prior orders.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Example 4:</strong></em> An office worker frequently complains to the building custodian that her office is poorly lighted. The best action for the building custodian to follow is to</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Ignore the complaints because they come from a habitual crank.</li>
        <li>Inform the worker that illumination is a fixed item built into the building originally and evidently is the result of faulty planning by the architect.</li>
        <li>Request a licensed electrician to install additional ceiling lights.</li>
        <li>Investigate for faulty illumination features in the room, such as dirty lamp globes and incorrect lamp wattage.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><b>Answer - (4)<br />
Explanations – </b>The repeated complaints may be quite legitimate if the lighting problem has not been corrected. Do not dismiss the office worker as a “crank.” The Custodian should check out the fixtures personality before calling in an electrician.
        Costs can be held down by having staff perform those tasks for which they are qualified.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Example 5:</strong></em> Suppose that one of your neighbors walks into the police precinct where you are an administrative aide and asks you to make 100 photocopies of a flyer he intends to distribute in the neighborhood. Of the following,
        what action should you take in this situation?</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Pretend that you do not know the person and order him to leave the building.</li>
        <li>Call a police officer and report the person for attempting to make illegal use of police equipment.</li>
        <li>Tell the person that you will make the copies when you are off duty.</li>
        <li>Explain that you cannot use police equipment for non-police work.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><b>Answer - (4)<br />
Explanations – </b>Where calm, reasoned explanation is offered as an answer choice, it is nearly always the correct answer. There is no need to be impolite or hostile to the neighbor. He may not even realize that he is asking you to do something that
        is not permitted. He will respect you for obeying the rules.</p>
