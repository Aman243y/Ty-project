    <h2>Number Series</h2>
    <p>In this type of test, a number series is given, out of which one number or alphabet is missing. So you are required to complete the series by analyzing the applied rule or pattern.</p>
    <h2>Rule for the Number Series</h2>
    <p>Some of the standard rules followed in estimating the next term are given below:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Each number may be the multiple of the other.</li>
        <li>In each number something may be added or deducted to get the second number and so on.</li>
        <li>The numbers may be divided to get the next number.</li>
        <li>The number may be squared to get the next one.</li>
        <li>The square root of the numbers may be taken to get the next number.</li>
        <li>Sometimes, odd numbers are followed or preceded by even numbers and vice versa.</li>
        <li>Sometimes, sometimes is added to get the next number and subtracted or divided or multiplied to get the next one.</li>
        <li>Sometimes, odd number is squared, the other multiplied thrice, fourth multiplied four times, etc. and then sometimes is added or subtracted.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Solved Example - Number Series</h2>
    <p><b>Question 1.</b> 20, 32, 45, 59, 74, ?<br /> (A) 95<br /> (B) 90<br /> (C) 85<br /> (D) 79</p>
    <p><b>Solution: </b>The differences between the consecutive terms of the series are 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, …..<br /> 2
        <sup>nd</sup> term = 1<sup>st</sup> term + 12 = 20 + 12 = 32<br /> 3
        <sup>rd</sup> term = 2<sup>nd</sup> term + 13 = 32 + 13 = 45<br /> 4
        <sup>th</sup> term = 3<sup>rd</sup> term + 14 = 45 + 14 = 59<br /> 5
        <sup>th</sup> term = 4<sup>th</sup> term + 15 = 59 + 15 = 74<br /> Thus, ? = 6<sup>th</sup> term = 5<sup>th</sup> term + 16 = 74 + 16 = 90<br />
        <strong>Hence, the answer is (B).</strong></p>
    <p><b>Question 2.</b> 210, 195, 175, 150, 120, ?<br /> (A) 75<br /> (B) 80<br /> (C) 85<br /> (D) 90</p>
    <p><b>Solution:</b> The differences between the consecutive terms of the series are -15, -20, -25, -30, -35, …<br /> 2
        <sup>nd</sup> term = 1<sup>st</sup> term – 15 = 210 – 15 = 195<br /> 3
        <sup>rd</sup> term = 2<sup>nd</sup> term – 20 = 195 – 20 = 175<br /> 4
        <sup>th</sup> term = 3<sup>rd</sup> term – 25 = 175 – 25 = 150<br /> 5
        <sup>th</sup> term = 4<sup>th</sup> term – 30 = 150 – 30 = 120<br /> Thus, ? = 6<sup>th</sup> term – 35 = 120 – 35 = 85<br />
        <strong>Hence, the answer is (C).</strong></p>
    <p><b>Question 3.</b> 3, 5, 10, 12, 24, 26, ?<br /> (A) 52<br /> (B) 30<br /> (C) 28<br /> (D) 48</p>
    <p><b>Solution:</b> Each odd term doubles the previous even term.<br /> 3th term = 2×2<sup>nd</sup> term=2×5=10<br /> 5th term = 2×4<sup>th</sup> term=2×12=24<br /> Thus, = 7<sup>th</sup> term = 2×6<sup>th</sup> term=2×26=52<br /> Hence, the answer is
        (A).<br />
        <strong>Hence, the answer is (A).</strong></p>
    <p><b>Question 5.</b> 2, 6, 10; 5, 9, 13; 10, 14, 18; ?, ?, ?.<br /> (A) 12, 14, 16<br /> (B) 14, 17, 20<br /> (C) 17, 21, 25<br /> (D) 15, 20, 25</p>
    <p><b>Solution:</b> Each group have a common difference of 4 among its consecutive terms. Also the difference between the consecutive first term of each group is 3, 5, 7, etc.<br /> Thus, ?, ?, ? = ( 10 + 7), (17 + 4), (21 + 4)<br /> = 17, 21, 25,<br
        />
        <strong>Hence, the answer is (C).</strong></p>

    <h2>Wrong Number</h2>
    <p>In this type, some numbers are arranged in a series and in sequence. One term in the series is wrong. You are asked to find out the wrong term, from the alternatives given. Therefore, you have to decipher a general pattern followed in the sequence,
        and then decide the wrong term accordingly.</p>
    <h2>Solved Example - Wrong Number</h2>
    <p><b>Question 1.</b> 1, 11, 26, 49, 80, 122, 169, 227, 290, 361<br /> (A) 49<br /> (B) 26<br /> (C) 80<br /> (D) 122</p>
    <p><b>Solution:</b> The differences between the consecutive terms of the series are<br /> 5, 8, 11; 5, 8, 11; ………<br /> ∴ 2<sup>nd</sup> term = 1<sup>st</sup> term + 10 = 1 + 10 = 11<br /> 3
        <sup>rd</sup> term = 2<sup>nd</sup> term + 10 + 5 = 11 + 10 + 5 = 26<br /> 4
        <sup>th</sup> term = 3<sup>rd</sup> term + 10 + 5 + 8 = 26 + 10 + 5 + 8 = 49<br /> 5
        <sup>th</sup> term = 4<sup>th</sup> term + 10 + 5 + 8 + 11 = 49 + 10 + 5 + 8 + 11 = 83<br /> Thus, fifth term should be 83 and not 80.<br />
        <strong>Hence, the answer is (C).</strong></p>
    <p><b>Question 2.</b> 11, 5, 20, 12, 40, 26, 74, 54<br /> (A) 5<br /> (B) 20<br /> (C) 26<br /> (D) 40</p>
    <p><b>Solution:</b> The differences between odd terms are 9, 18, 36, ……….<br /> 3
        <sup>rd</sup> term = 1<sup>st</sup> term + 9 = 11 + 9 = 20<br /> 5
        <sup>th</sup> term = 3<sup>rd</sup> term + 18 = 20 + 18 = 38<br /> 7
        <sup>th</sup> term = 5<sup>th</sup> term + 36 = 38 + 36 = 74<br /> Thus, 5<sup>th</sup> term should be 38 and not 40.<br />
        <strong>Hence, the answer is (D).</strong></p>
    <p><b>Question 3.</b> 3, 6, 5, 20, 7, 42, 9, 74<br /> (A) 6<br /> (B) 42<br /> (C) 74<br /> (D) 20</p>
    <p><b>Solution:</b> Differences between the even terms of the series are 14, 22, 30……<br /> 4
        <sup>th</sup> term = 2<sup>nd</sup> term + 14 = 6 + 14 = 20<br /> 6
        <sup>th</sup> term = 4<sup>th</sup> term + 22 = 20 + 22 = 42<br /> 8
        <sup>th</sup> term = 6<sup>th</sup> term + 30 = 42 + 30 = 72<br /> Thus, 8<sup>th</sup> term should be 72 and not 74.<br />
        <strong>Hence, the answer is (C).</strong></p>
    <p><b>Question 4.</b> 19, 17, 14, 11, 7<br /> (A) 14<br /> (B) 17<br /> (C) 11<br /> (D) 19</p>
    <p><b>Solution: </b>The difference between odd terms of the series is 6.<br /> 3
        <sup>rd</sup> term = 1<sup>st</sup> term – 6 = 19 – 6 = 13<br /> 5
        <sup>th</sup> term = 3<sup>rd</sup> term – 6 = 13 – 6 = 7<br /> Thus, 3<sup>rd</sup> term should be 13 and not 14.<br />
        <strong>Hence, the answer is (A).</strong></p>
    <h2>Alphabet Series</h2>
    <p>In such series, a series of alphabets is given, and which follow a pattern throughout in a series. Therefore, you have to decipher the pattern and complete the series, by choosing the correct alternative given in question.</p>
    <h2>Rules for the Alphabet Series</h2>
    <p>Some of the standard rules followed in estimating the next term in alphabet series are discussed below:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Keep the order of letters with their respective numbers, i.e. A = 1 …Z = 26 and vice versa i.e. Z = 26 and vice versa i.e. Z = 1 … A = 26.</li>
        <li>When the counting is circular, after Z, the cycle will continue from A.</li>
        <li>Sometimes, letters are committed in sequence, e.g. ABC-, EFG-, Here D and H in sequence are omitted.</li>
        <li>Sometimes, equal number of letters are omitted, e.g. in ADG, two consecutive letters are omitted.</li>
        <li>One following the letter and the other preceding it may be organized e.g. in BCA, C follows B and A precedes B.</li>
        <li>Sometimes, there may be repetition of letters in a set order, e.g. in aab, abc-, one letter is repeated twice, the next set could be ccd.</li>
        <li>Sometimes, numbers are mixed with letters, the number may refer to the position of the letters in the alphabet.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2><strong>Solved Example - Alphabet Series</strong></h2>
    <p><b>Question 1.</b> ABXW, EFTS, ?, MNLK<br /> (A) IJOP<br /> (B) IJPO<br /> (C) JIOP<br /> (D) JIPO</p>
    <p><b>Solution:</b> First and second terms are in alphabetical order, while third and fourth term are in reverse order. Therefore, missing item is IJPO.<br />
        <strong>Hence, the answer is (B).</strong></p>
    <p><b>Question 2.</b> A Z X B V T C R ?<br /> (A) E, O<br /> (B) O, Q<br /> (C) F, O<br /> (D) P, D</p>
    <p><b>Solution: </b> The first, fourth and seventh letters are in alphabetical order. Thus, tenth letter would be after C i.e. D. Also, second and third letters are in reverse order and so are the fifth and sixth letters.<br />
        <strong>Hence, the answer is (D).</strong></p>
    <p><b>Question 3.</b> P3C, R5F, T8I, VI2, L, ?<br /> (A) YI7O<br /> (B) XI7M<br /> (C) XI7O<br /> (D) XI6O</p>
    <p><b>Solution:</b> The first letter of the terms are alternating. And the sequences is followed by the numbers is +2, +3, +4 …….. The last latter of the each term has moved three steps forward to the last letter, ? = XI7O<br />
        <strong>Hence, the answer is (C)</strong></p>
    <p><b>Question 4.</b> AK, EO, IS, ? , QA, UE<br /> (A) LV<br /> (B) MW<br /> (C) NX<br /> (D) LW<br /> (E) MV</p>
    <p><b>Solution:</b> The first and second letters of each term are skipped four steps forward to obtain the next term. ? = MW.<br />
        <strong>Hence, the answer is (B).</strong></p>
