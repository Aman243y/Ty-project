    <title>Statement Assumption</title>
</head>

<body>
    <p><b>Statement</b><strong> Assumption : </strong>All theories and statements are based on certain assumptions. We say something, comment on certain things on the basis of certain assumptions. Sometimes assumptions are obvious, sometimes they are not.<br
        /> If I make a statement “if you are taking guidance in XYZ coaching, your chance of getting through IBPS exam is high”, what assumption you can make from this statement? XYZ coaching institute is providing reasonable guidance to its students.
        This is a valid assumption.</p>
    <h2>Rules for statement Assumption</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pay attention to the key words, phrases etc.</li>
        <li>Try to differentiate between implication and assumption. Implication means you are deriving some conclusion from the statement and assumption is something on which statement is based, which is assumed, supposed and taken for granted.</li>
        <li>Don’t assume information unless you see it in the statement.<br />
            <strong>Statement</strong> “Join our ‘Feel Good’ health center and see the effects on your beauty in just 10 days”. -An advertisement of a health center.<br />
            <strong id="Important-Notes">Assumptions<br />
        </strong><strong>I.</strong> Youngsters want to look beautiful.<br />
            <strong>II.</strong> People like to be considered beautiful.<br />
            <strong>Explanation: </strong>The statement does not mention youngsters. This is an advertisement for people of all ages. So, assumption I is not implicit. The purpose of the advertisement is to lure people, hence the assumption behind the
            statement is that people like to be considered beautiful. So, assumption II is implicit.</li>
        <li>If any direction or instruction or order is given by a person on higher post to his/her subordinates or sub-workers or to the people working under, then it is generally assumed that the people or the subordinates will obey that instruction or
            direction or order. Hence, any assumption against this will not be implicit.<br />
            <strong>Statement</strong> “Complete this project on water management by tomorrow”. Senior officer to his subordinate.<br />
            <strong>Assumptions<br />
        </strong><strong>I.</strong> The subordinate will comply with the orders of his senior.<br />
            <strong>II.</strong> The subordinate will not complete the project by tomorrow.<br />
            <strong>Explanation:</strong> Assumption I is implicit. If the senior officer had not assumed that his subordinate would comply, he would not have asked him to do the job. Assumption II is just the opposite and hence not implicit.</li>
        <li>Any policy is made by the government or the person on higher post, assuming that the policy will be beneficial for the people.<br />
            <strong>Statement-</strong> Government has announced a special policy on eradication of pneumonia from India.<br />
            <strong>Assumptions<br />
        </strong><strong>I.</strong> The policy will lower down the cases of pneumonia.<br />
            <strong>II.</strong> The policy will not be implemented recently.<br />
            <strong>Explanation: </strong>Assumption I is implicit. The assumption behind the policy is that it will lower and further eradicate pneumonia from India. Assumption II is not implicit as it is against the statement. If the policy is not implemented
            recently, it will be of little benefit to the people.</li>
        <li>Instruction to do anything is given, assuming that the person, who is directed or instructed, knows how to do it.<br />
            <strong>Statement</strong> The CEO instructed his secretary to complete the data by tomorrow.<br />
            <strong>Assumptions<br />
        </strong><strong>I.</strong> The secretary cannot do the work.<br />
            <strong>II.</strong> The secretary will give the complete work.<br />
            <strong>Explanation: </strong>Assumption I is not implicit as the CEO has instructed his secretary to complete the work assuming that he will finish it. He can finish the work only if he knows how to do it. Hence, only assumption II is implicit.</li>
        <li>If the assumption is followed by ‘only’, ‘all’, ‘if’, ‘generally’ etc then that assumption is a false one.<br />
            <strong>Statement</strong> “Be an expert of CSAT in two weeks” — An advertisement.<br />
            <strong>Assumptions<br />
        </strong><strong>I.</strong> Students will pay attention to this.<br />
            <strong>II.</strong> Students Wi-Fi pay no heed to this advertisement.<br />
            <strong>Explanation:</strong> Clearly I is implicit as the basic objective of the advertisement is to attract students. II is not implicit.<br />
            <strong>Statement</strong> We should go for financial inclusion.<br />
            <strong>Assumptions<br />
        </strong><strong>I.</strong> This is the only way to ensure economic equality.<br />
            <strong>II.</strong> This will help in strengthening the conditions of the rural people.<br />
            <strong>Explanation: </strong>Clearly, assumption I is not implicit due to use of the word ‘only’. There can be other ways also to ensure economic equality. II is a right assumption</li>
        <li>If nothing is given about future, and anything is assumed, then the assumption can either be implicit or not.<br />
            <strong>Statement</strong> He is investing a lot in a particular share.<br />
            <strong>Assumptions<br />
        </strong><strong>I.</strong> He may incur loss in this. II. He may gain from this.<br /> Here, either I or II is implicit as anything from these two can happen.</li>
        <li>The purpose of any banner or advertisement is always to attract the people. Hence, it is assumed that these will attract people and people will read and follow these.<br />
            <strong>Statement</strong> “Be an expert of CSAT in two weeks” — An advertisement.<br />
            <strong>Assumptions<br />
        </strong><strong>I.</strong> Students will pay attention to this.<br />
            <strong>II.</strong> Students Wi-Fi pay no heed to this advertisement.<br />
            <strong>Explanation:</strong> Clearly I is implicit as the basic objective of the advertisement is to attract students. II is not implicit.</li>
        <li>Increase in price or giving discount on any object is done with the purpose of attracting the people and with the assumption that people will still buy the products in case of price-hike and more products will be sold in case of discount.<br />
            <strong>Statement</strong>- A TV retailer has offered 20% discount on all TV sets.<br />
            <strong>Assumptions<br />
        </strong><strong>I.</strong> Sale of TV sets will go up.<br />
            <strong>II.</strong> Sale of TV sets will not rise.<br />
            <strong>Explanation :</strong>Clearly, I is implicit as it is the main purpose behind offering discount. II is not implicit.</li>
        <li>Advice is given by a people to another, assuming that the other people will listen to it. Warning is given, assuming that it will produce the desired effects. A punishment may follow warnings only if there is no effect of those warnings.<br />
            <strong>Statement</strong> “I will punish you, if I again see you talking in the class. This is the last warning. “—A teacher to a student.<br />
            <strong>Assumptions<br />
        </strong><strong>I.</strong> The teacher has the authority to punish them.<br />
            <strong>II.</strong> A punishment must always follow some warnings.<br />
            <strong>Example:</strong> Assumption I is obvious by the way the teacher says to the student. A punishment may follow warnings, if there is no effect of warnings. It is clearly mentioned that this is the last warning. So, assumption II is
            also assumed.</li>
        <li>If any target or meeting or function is fixed by a group or board or dignitaries, then it is assumed foot that the target will be met in future and the organization will be functioning till the scheduled time in future.<br />
            <strong>Statement</strong> The next meeting of the board of directors will be held after six months.<br />
            <strong>Assumptions<br />
        </strong><strong>I.</strong> The company will remain in function after six months,<br />
            <strong>II.</strong> The board of directors Wi-Fi be dissolved in future.<br />
            <strong>Explanation</strong> :Obviously, before stating the statement, the author has assumed that the Company will be functioning after six months, otherwise he would not have fixed the date of the meeting six months later. So, assumption
            I is implicit, But there is no mention of assumption II in the statement, thus it is notimplicit. Comparison of data of any 2 years or comparison of any two products on the basis of sale is based on the assumption that the data required in
            statement is known.<br />
            <strong>Statement</strong> - India has performed better than the previous year in terms of per capita income.<br />
            <strong>Assumptions<br />
        </strong><strong>I.</strong> The per capita incomes of current as well as previous years are known<br />
            <strong>II.</strong> India will perform better in future also.<br />
            <strong>Explanation :</strong>Assumption I is implicit as unless the data regarding per capita incomes of current and previous years are known, the statement could not have been made assumption II is not implicit as nothing about future is
            mentioned in the statement.</li>
