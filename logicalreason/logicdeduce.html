<body>
    <p>As the name itself suggests, logical deduction questions require logical thinking. Every question starts off with a premise which might be of any one of the following types:</p>
    <h2>Logical Deduction Premises- Various Patterns</h2>
    <p><strong>Type 1: If A Happens B Happens</strong><br /> This means that A leads B, but does not mean the reverse, i.e., if B has happened, A must have happened. In such situations, A is a sufficient condition for B, but is not a necessary condition.<br
        /> Letâ€™s look at the following example:<br /> If I go to a movie, I enjoy myself.<br /> This would mean, that if I have gone to the movie, I will definitely enjoy myself. However, it does not mean that if I have enjoyed myself, I must have gone
        to the movie- there are so many ways of enjoying yourself.<br /> Another example of this type would be:<br /> If Amitabh acts in a move, he will earn money.<br /> This does not mean that if he has earned money, he must have acted in the movie.</p>
    <p><strong>Type 2: Only If A Happens B Happens</strong><br /> In this case, A is necessary and sufficient condition for the occurrence of B. In this case, there is reversibility of the logic, i..e.., if B has happened, A must have happened.<br /> Only
        If Saurav plays the match, will he get a hundred.<br /> If Saurav has got a hundred, he must have played the match.</p>
    <p><strong>Type 3: If A Happens B does not Happen</strong><br /> In this case, if A has happened, B does not happen. The opposite is also true, i.e.., if B has happened. A must not have happened.<br /> If Martina plays well, Sania will not win.</p>
    <p><strong>Type 4: If A does not Happen B will Happen</strong><br /> Again in this case, the reverse might not be true.<br /> If Anand does not come, Kasparov will. This does not mean that if Kasparov comes, Anand will not come.</p>
    <p><strong>Type 5: Either A or B will Happen</strong><br /> One of the two has to happen. At the same time, the two events are exclusive of one another. If one happens, the other will not happen.<br /> Either he becomes a TV star or he becomes a movie
        star.</p>
    <h2>Solved Example Logical Deduction</h2>
    <p><strong>Example 1.</strong> Shahrukh either acts a villain, or he acts as a hero.<br /> A. Shahrukh acts like a hero.<br /> B. Shahrukh does not act like a villain.<br /> C. Shahrukh acts like a villain.<br /> D. Shahrukh does not act like a hero.<br
        />
        <strong>(a)</strong> CD only , <strong>(b)</strong> BA only ,<strong> (c)</strong> CD &amp; BA , <strong>(d)</strong> None of these</p>
    <p>This question is based on the EITHER- OR premise. Thus, we can see that CD is correct. Since, if he acts like a villain- (Statement C) he will not act like a hero (Statement D).<br /> Similarly, BA can also be seen to be true. Hence option (c) is
        correct.</p>
    <p><strong>Example </strong><strong>2.</strong> Whenever Martin goes to a movie, he has nightmares.<br /> A. Martin did not have nightmares.<br /> B. Martin went to a movie.<br /> C. Martin had nightmares.<br /> D. Martin did not go to the movie.</p>
    <p><strong>(a)</strong> AD , <strong>(b)</strong> DC , <strong>(c)</strong> CB , <strong>(d)</strong> DA</p>
    <p>When A happens, However, if A does not happen, it is not necessary that B will not happen. Also, if B has happened, it is not necessary that A must have happened. However, if B has not happened, it is necessary that A must not have happened.<br />        Thus, AD is the only correct sequence.</p>
    <p><strong>Example </strong><strong>3.</strong> If I talk to my girl friends, then I do not need to take a pill for heartache.<br /> A. I talked to my girl friends.<br /> B. I did not need to take a pill for heartache.<br /> C. I needed to take a pill
        for heartache.<br /> D. I did not talk to my girl friends.</p>
    <p><strong>(a)</strong> AB only , <strong>(b)</strong> DC only , <strong>(c)</strong> CD only ,<strong> (d)</strong> AB and CD</p>
    <p>This question falls under the category of if A happens, then B does not happen. However, if B has not happened, if does not mean that A has happened. AB and CD are both logically correct.</p>
