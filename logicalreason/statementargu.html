    <p><strong>1. ‘Strong arguments’ are directly related to the question.</strong><br />
        <strong> 2. ‘Weak arguments’ are not directly related to the question.</strong><br /> In these questions, a statement is followed by two arguments. A strong argument is that which touches the practical and real aspect of the situation as described
        in the statement. A weak argument is very simple, superfluous and long drawn one. Candidates are required to distinguish between the strong and weak arguments. Steps to Mark Strong or Weak, Arguments.</p>
    <h2>Rules for strong and weak argument</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong id="Important-Notes">A strong argument</strong> should relate with the statement and be supported by facts or established notions, but it should not be a factual statement.<br />
            <strong>Statement</strong> Rural tourism should be encouraged in rural areas.<br />
            <strong>Arguments</strong><br />
            <strong>I.</strong> Yes, rural people are creative.<br />
            <strong>II.</strong> Yes, this would help to solve problems of unemployment to some extent.<br />
            <strong>Explanation:</strong> Argument I is a factual statement. It may be true or may not be true. So, it is a weak argument. Argument<br />
            <strong>II</strong> gives a strong reason for promotion of rural tourism. So, it is a strong argument. 8</li>
        <li><strong>A strong argument</strong> should give the deep analysis of the topic dealt within the statement.<br />
            <strong>Statement</strong> Traditional culture should be preferred to modern culture.<br />
            <strong>Argument</strong> No, both have their good points as well as bad points.<br />
            <strong>Explanation :</strong>The argument above is a super fluous one. It does not give any analysis of the core of the topic. It gives no reasons. Hence, it is a weak argument.</li>
        <li><strong>A strong argumen</strong>t gives the realistic diagnosis of the situation described in the statement.<br />
            <strong>Statement</strong> Nuclear families are better than joint families.<br />
            <strong>Argument</strong> No, joint families ensure security and also reduce the burden of work.<br />
            <strong>Explanation:</strong> Above argument provides a realistic diagnosis of the situation given in the question. So, it is a strong argument.</li>
        <li>The argument must be judged as an argument not as an opinion<br />
            <strong>Statement</strong> Should India be declared a ‘developed country’?<br />
            <strong>Argument</strong> Yes, why not.<br />
            <strong>Explanation:</strong> The argument is in the form of a counter-question, which shows it is an opinion of the author, any strong’ reason. Hence, this is not a strong’ argument.</li>
        <li><strong>A strong argument</strong> should not be mere reiteration of the situation given in the statement.</li>
        <li><strong>Whenever any argument</strong> is followed by ‘only’, then that is generally a weak argument as that may not be only possible case.<br />
            <strong>Statement</strong> All the rivers should be connected.<br />
            <strong>Arguments<br />
</strong><strong>I.</strong> Yes, this is the only way of checking floods.<br />
            <strong>II.</strong> Yes, this will prove very helpful for irrigation.<br />
            <strong>Explanation</strong> :Argument I is a weak argument due to the use of word ‘only’. There may be other ways to check floods also. So, it is a weak argument. II is a strong argument as it is providing sufficient reason in favor of the
            situation.</li>
        <li>Whenever any argument covers a mass or the government or higher authority then you cannot direct them. So, in these cases if the argument is followed by ‘must’, then that is generally a weak argument. But a person on higher post may direct and
            instruct his/her subordinates (or mass).<br />
            <strong>Statement</strong> Social and financial inclusion are Iwo very important and fruitful steps for reducing the gap between various classes.<br />
            <strong>Arguments<br />
</strong><strong>I.</strong> Yes, government must take all possible steps to ensure this.<br />
            <strong>II.</strong> Yes, government should encourage and promote this.<br />
            <strong>Expiation :</strong>Argument is a weak argument as government cannot be forced to take any step. We should keep faith in the governance process. So, due to use of word must’, it is a weak argument. II is a strong argument. II says
            that government should encourage this.<br /> This is the right way of arguments, with a person on higher authority, with the use of word ‘should’.</li>
        <li>Whenever instead of saying anything about the statement, some other ways or some alternate options are provided in the argument, then that is a weak argument.<br />
            <strong>Statement</strong> India should go for more nuclear power plants.<br />
            <strong>Arguments<br />
</strong><strong>I.</strong> Yes, it is safe and efficient.<br />
            <strong>II.</strong> No, India should go for more hydro-power plants.<br />
            <strong>Explanation:</strong> Argument II is a weak argument as it is providing an alternate option instead of arguing for or against the statement. us a strong argument as it is in favour of the statement and providing solid reasons for the
            statement.</li>
        <li>Whenever any argument is based on the comparisons, like comparison with other country etc, then that argument is a weak one.<br />
            <strong>Statement:-</strong> India should adopt one child policy.<br />
            <strong>Arguments<br />
</strong><strong>I.</strong> No, this is not possible.<br />
            <strong>II.</strong> Yes, China has adopted this policy, so we should adopt this.<br />
            <strong>Explanation :</strong>Argument II is based on the comparison but the condition of India is different from China, so it is not right to go for comparisons. Hence II is a weak argument. is also weak as it does not provide a valid reason
            for the argument.</li>
        <li>An argument can be valid without being true in real world. So, you should go with the question without interpreting anything by yourself. For example-All birds can fly. An ostrich is a bird. So, according to the statement an ostrich can fly. Your
            answer should be this only.</li>
        <li>Ambiguous arguments are weak arguments. In such statements, the writer’s intention is not clear and their is no co-relation between the statement and the arguments and course of action.<br />
            <strong>Statement</strong> One should enjoy life because tomorrow one has to die.<br />
            <strong>Argument</strong> No, instead one should strive to achieve a goal rather than think of death as a goal.<br />
            <strong>Explanation:</strong> Here the argument is ambiguous. Both statement and argument are different and unrelated. Argument is not related to the statement and only a hint of it is made. So, it is a weak argument</li>
