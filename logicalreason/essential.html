    <title>Essential part</title>
</head>

<body>
    <p>You may be shown an underlined world followed by four answer options and then asked to pick the answer that describe a “necessary part” of the word in the question. Sounds like mumbo jumbo, we know, but take a minute to hear us out.</p>
    <p>For answer option to be absolutely essential to the question word’s definition or purpose (in other words, for it to be the “necessary part”), you must be able to answer “yes” to the following questions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Does the answer choice describe the real meaning of the word in the question?</li>
        <li>Does the answer choice tell me the overriding purpose of the word in the question?</li>
        <li>Does the answer choice describe an element of the word in the question that’s so important that the word wouldn’t exist without it?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Getting a “no” answer to one of these questions should help you eliminate incorrect answers for a necessary-part question. Following are a couple examples of necessary-part questions; we walk you through the thought process so you can feel confident
        when you face these questions on the essential part.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Mystery</strong></em></p>
    <p>(A) Novel<br /> (B) Detective<br /> (C) Secrecy<br /> (D) Solution</p>
    <p>Think about the nature of a mystery. If there’s a mystery, something is unknown. Eliminate choices that don’t describe the essential element of not knowing. What about Choice (A)? Mystery novels exist, but a mystery doesn’t have to be told in a novel
        to be a mystery. A mystery without a novel would still be a mystery. Toss out choice (A). A detective, choice (B), tries to solve a mystery, but even if no detective showed up to figure out the mystery, the mystery would still exist. A mystery
        doesn’t require a solution, In fact, after there’s solution, a mystery is no longer a mystery. So Choice (D) actually describes something that’s an unnecessary part of a mystery. Now you’re left with choice (C), secrecy, If a mystery didn’t contain
        an element of secrecy, would it still be a mystery? No, the very nature of a mystery is that something is unknown, hidden, or secret, Choice (C) is the correct answer.</p>
    <p><em><b>Parka</b></em></p>
    <p>(A) Fashion<br /> (B) Comfort<br /> (C) Snow<br /> (D) Warmth</p>
    <p>Eliminate answer choices that don’t state the primary reason for wearing a parka. Sure, you can wear a parka to make a fashion statement, but a parka isn’t necessarily fashionable. Choice (A) isn’t right. A cozy parka may offer comfort, but comfort
        isn’t the main reason you wear a parka. (You may want to leave Choice (B) alone until you read through the rest of the choices, though.) Snow, isn’t the only condition that necessitates wearing a parka; you could need a parka for warmth in all
        sorts of chilly conditions. The primary reason for a parka – Its essential purpose for exiting – is to provide warmth, which means Choice (D) is a better answer than Choice (B).</p>
